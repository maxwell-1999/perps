      <p>4. Analytics</p>

      <p>
        Third party analytics tools collect or use information about your use of the Interface, which helps us improve
        the Interface. We want to process as little personal information as possible when you use the Interface. That's
        why we've chosen Fathom Analytics for Interface analytics, which doesn't use cookies and complies with the GDPR,
        ePrivacy (including PECR), COPPA, and CCPA. Using this privacy-friendly website analytics software, your IP
        address is only briefly processed, and we (running this website) have no way of identifying you. As per the
        CCPA, your personal information is de-identified. You can read more about this on Fathom Analytics' website.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if you’d like to entirely exclude your anonymized visits from showing up in our analytics, go to the
        Fathom Analytics Exclude Your Visits page for opt-out instructions.
      </p>

      <p>5. Sanctions and Risk Management</p>

      <p>
        We use Chainalysis, a third party blockchain intelligence service provider to detect, prevent, and mitigate
        financial crime and other illicit or harmful activities on the Interface. Chainalysis combines on-chain data and
        real-world investigations to identify financial crime and other high-risk activities. Perennial applies an
        industry-wide standard of risk categories (e.g., sanctions, ransomware, child exploitation, stolen funds).
        Addresses that fall into a risk category are blocked from accessing the Perennial App. User wallet addresses
        connecting to the Perennial app will be cross-checked using a Chainalysis on-chain oracle with designated risk
        categories. Users are not identified in this risk-assessment process. We do not retain the information we
        collect any longer than necessary for these purposes.
      </p>

      <p>We record blocked address events that occur through the Chainalysis API.</p>

      <p>6. Governmental Entities</p>

      <p>
        We may combine any information collected with information made available in third party databases and public
        sources. We may use such information to address claims, to respond to governmental inquires or requests, or to
        investigate issues. Further, such information may be shared with governmental entities including criminal,
        civil, and, regulatory agencies. Please be aware that we may keep copies of your information subject to our
        internal retention policies for the purposes of abiding by Applicable Laws or to prevent fraud or injury to a
        third party.
      </p>

      <p>7. Accessing and Editing Your Information</p>

      <p>
        If you have any questions regarding any information collected please contact us at privacy@perennial.finance.
      </p>

      <p>8. Opt Out of Commercial, Non-Commercial Communications and Do Not Track</p>

      <p>
        If you decide to provide us with your contact information, you agree that we may send you communications via
        emails or other methods. However, you may choose to unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying
        Perennial that you no longer wish to receive these communications, we will endeavour to honor such requests
        promptly. If you wish to opt out of certain communications or information collection, please contact us at
        privacy@perennial.finance.
      </p>

      <p>9. Third Party Websites and Links</p>

      <p>
        When accessing a third party site through our Interface, you acknowledge that you are aware that these third
        party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by us, and you release us from any liability for
        the conduct of these third party websites. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in
        place, in addition to any amendments, do not create rights enforceable by third parties. Perennial bears no
        responsibility for the information collected or used by any third party website. You must review their policies
        to understand how their information collection practices work.
      </p>

      <p>10. Security Measures</p>

      <p>
        We make reasonable attempts to protect your information by using physical and electronic safeguards such as
        encryption. However, as the Interface relies on Blockchain Technology and electronic infrastructure that we have
        no control over, we can make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information submitted. For this
        reason, we recommend that you use anti-virus software, firewalls, and other precautions to protect yourself from
        security and privacy threats.
      </p>

      <p>11. Age Compliance</p>

      <p>
        We do not collect or process any information for any persons under the age of majority in your jurisdiction
        (“Minors”). Please do not submit information to us if you are under the age of majority in your applicable
        jurisdiction. In the event that we have inadvertently collected any information from a Minor please contact us
        immediately.
      </p>

      <p>12. International Transfer</p>

      <p>
        Your information may be transferred to – and maintained on – computers located outside of your state, province,
        country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your
        jurisdiction. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents
        your agreement to that transfer. Information that is submitted to Perennial will be collected, processed,
        stored, disclosed, and disposed of in accordance with applicable United States’ law and this policy. In
        addition, such information may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction. United States’
        law may not provide the degree of protection for information that is available in other countries.
      </p>

      <p>13. Merger and Acquisition</p>

      <p>
        In the event that Perennial is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets,
        your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. Please be aware that once the information is
        transferred your privacy rights may change.
      </p>

      <p>14. Amendments</p>

      <p>
        Like our User Terms, we may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we amend this Privacy Policy, we
        will modify the date listed on this Privacy Policy or we may contact you. You must agree to the amendments as a
        condition of your continued use of our Interface. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease using our
        Interface.
